# Clima ‚òÅ

## My Goal

The objective of this app is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. I've learned to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What I've created

I've made a weather detection app that would tell you the current weather of any location you enter.
